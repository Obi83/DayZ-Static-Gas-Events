# DayZ-Static-Gas-Events
Here some Static-Gas-Clouds Events for every military camp in Chernarus DayZ. This includes a cfgeffectarea.json and zombie_territories.xml.



# Welcome to Static Gas Events

This file adds 29 areas of toxic gas clouds all over Chernarus Military Camps.
These are Static Events and spawning in as a player nearby. 

It brings a hugh change to RollPlay- and Hardcore Survival- Server because it will make the game even more harder, more immersive and give it a more apocalyptic touch.
which means, if you cant run straight up to military stuff and camps you have to find another way to loot up first and stay healthy!! 

This works fantastic with Hardcore Survival Server in Cold Winter. It brings a lot of fun and a lot of dying if you arnt prepaired enough. 
Can also make PvP extremly rough if u running PvP-Zones on your Server.
(Attention to your NBC Stuff in types.xml file you may wanna change it a bit.)




# Files

Also the zombie_territories.xml file adds NBC Zombies to every area i create. 
You can copy/paste the full vanilla file or add the lines from the update.xml file into your zombie_territories.xml file. 
For RP and HCS Server i highly recommend mods which makes zombies more harder like @CJ187-HarderZombies or so and add some Horde of the Undead.

This mod dont need a .pbo file or a key. Just copy/paste the files on your server and it will load in at every Server-Start. 
Also how it works: https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/DayZ:Contaminated_Areas_Configuration

You can adjust or edit every place if you want. there is one example file of how it works and how to setup an area on your own. 
Also feel free to edit the amount of zombies in zombie-territories.xml to spawn in if server performance is a thing,
or change areas in cfgeffectarea.json if you want more or less gas in Chernarus. Also do what ever you want with it. Its just a simple file.



# Work in progress:
- Livonia
- Deer Isle
- Bitterroot
- Esseker
- Winter Versions



# Please let me know if the files need any changes or if some zombies not spawning in or so.


Hope you find a use for my first tiny stuff,
